                        This accelerating change raises the critical question of how to best prepare diverse students to become <b>AI literate citizens</b>, namely,<br></p>

                        <ol>

                        <br> -->

                        <p class="mb-4">Children growing up today are not only digital natives, they are AI natives -- touching and using AI-powered products and services in social media, digital assistants, search engines, and more -- without really being aware of how it works or how it can shape and influence their life and their future.  Inclusive AI Literacy for children is about preparing students with an important foundation of skills, knowledge and attitudes to understand enough about AI to be responsible users of AI-enabled technologies in their daily life, to prepare them to become the ethical and empathetic designers of AI solutions of tomorrow, while also being mindful about how to support students with different learning needs during their educational journey.   </p>

                        <p class="mb-4">To better prepare diverse children for an equitable and inclusive future of successes in an increasingly AI-infused world, this research project explores two key ways Artificial Intelligence can impact the future of education:<br></p>

                        <ol>
                        <li>Child-friendly intelligent learning companion technologies that help children learn by personalizing and adapting to support diverse learning needs. In this Project, we focus on its application in early childhood for communication and literacy development using emotionally engaging social robots.</li>
                        <li>Preparing students to be responsible, AI literate citizens. To do so, we are developing an innovative and inclusive curriculum called Responsible AI for Computational Action. Our initial focus is to develop this curriculum along with supporting hands-on learning projects, tools, technologies, and teacher professional development for middle school.  Over time, we intend to expand this for primary, middle and secondary schools, and make these available for broad use.</li>

                        <h5>Inclusive AI Literacy for Middle School</h5><br>

                        <p>We are excited to be collaborating with Dubai Heights Academy (DHA) and schools in the United States to develop the first inclusive AI literacy curriculum for middle school. We want to make sure it supports a diversity of learners who have a range of interests, learning needs, and styles. We also want to prepare diverse students to be able to take control of AI technologies and become ethical designers and conscientious users. The job opportunities for those with competence in innovative technologies are already growing rapidly worldwide across many industries and markets, and the future is very bright for students who have skills in computational thinking and artificial intelligence.  </p><br>

Students “learn-by-making”, supported and scaffolded by teachers as knowledgeable guides and mentors,  to acquire technical skills and concepts in AI and computational thinking while also learning important teamwork and 21st-century skills such as collaboration, communication, creative problem-solving, critical thinking, and design thinking. To support this, we are developing and providing students with intuitive block-based coding tools and other technologies so they are empowered to make computational projects with exciting AI capabilities. As this curriculum is under development, we will be iterating and revising our materials, incorporating feedback from students and teachers, while being mindful of how to adapt them to support students with diverse learning needs.

                        <h5>Personalized Learning Companions for Early Childhood Education</h5><br>

                        <p>In this Project we will also be exploring and investigating how AI-enabled technologies can strengthen young children’s learning skills. Specifically, we will be exploring how socially interactive robots can support personalized learning in early childhood (focusing on children 4 to 6 years old) for communication and early literacy skills. We are working with Dubai Heights Academy as well as underserved schools in the US.</p> <br>

                        <div id="module" >
                                <p class="collapse" id="collapseExample1" aria-expanded="false">Our prior research has shown that children with various learning needs respond well to playful, almost pet-like, learning companion robots.  Our robots are designed to play educational games with children to enhance or augment what children naturally gain in the classroom with teachers. At MIT we’ve been able to show significant learning improvement in things like vocabulary and early literacy skills by having the robot automatically personalize its interactions with young children.  We are particularly interested in investigating how this personalization can support diverse learners with different learning needs. We will also be exploring new learning experiences, like augmented reality, and how this can support young children’s learning in new ways.<br><br>

                        We want to make sure that the robot is a polite and socially inclusive playmate—so we will be developing new capabilities for the robot to interact with small groups (adult-child-robot or child-child-robot). Importantly, the robot is not designed to replace or compete with teachers. Rather, it should be viewed as a fun and engaging practice partner, especially for children who need additional support. As part of this program, we will be collecting speech data from young children (with their parents’ permission) so that the robot can get better and better at understanding what young children say. Teachers will be able to track children’s progress with the robot, and the information the robot provides can be useful to teachers.  We will be iterating and co-designing the teacher interface with their input to make sure it’s useful and easy to use. <br><br>

                        At Dubai Heights Academy, the robots will be available in an afterschool setting. A member from our MIT research team will be present to help support DHA staff and students with the robot. We are also working with preK and Kindergarten classrooms in the US to understand how social robots can enhance and augment classroom time. We are also exploring home use to understand how social robots can help reinforce learning at home with parents. During a time of remote learning for so many young children, understanding how social robots can be an effective distance learning technology for early childhood education is extremely important. <br><br>

                        By the end of this three-year exploration, we hope to have developed a social robot learning experience that can be piloted and evaluated for learning efficacy in the next phase of the project. <br></p>

                        <p>This academic year, beginning later in the first term of 2020, we are introducing Y6 and Y7 students at Dubai Heights Academy to learning modules on computational thinking. Specifically, we are bringing the CoolThink curriculum to DHA students. CoolThink was developed jointly over the past three years by MIT and the <a href "https://www.eduhk.hk/en/">Education University in Hong Kong </a> and has been rigorously evaluated by the Stanford Research Institute.</p><br>

Our goal this year for DHA is to prepare students with a solid foundation for our Y7 -- Y9 AI literacy curriculum.  Over time, we will deepen our offering for Y7 to include more AI Literacy modules while we also expand the curriculum to Y8 and Y9. We anticipate students will do these activities on average one session per week during students’ Computer Science class. Sessions will be led by the DHA Computer Science teacher and a MIT mentor.<br><br>

                                The social robot learning companion work will begin next year beginning in the first term of 2021.</p>
