      <h1>What is the DAILy Curriculum?</h1>
      <br />
      Everyone will be impacted by AI in daily life and in the workplaces of the
      future. It is critical for all students to have fundamental knowledge of
      AI and to understand AI's potential for good and harm. The Daily-AI
      program will jumpstart your readiness for AI and give you the tools you
      need to prepare for the AI-enabled world.<br /><br />
      The Daily-AI workshop, designed by MIT educators and experienced
      facilitators, features hands-on and computer-based activities on AI
      concepts, ethical issues in AI, creative expression using AI, and how AI
      relates to your future. You will experience training and using machine
      learning to make predictions, investigate bias in machine learning
      applications, use generative adversarial networks to create novel works of
      art, and learn to recognize the AI you interact with daily and in the
      world around you.
